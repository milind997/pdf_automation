Description:

Document Automation System (DASH)

Data Scientist

Built a semantic search and document QnA system for retrieving A large-scale
document automation platform used by multiple enterprise clients, capable of
processing over 1 million documents per day.

Key Contributions:

Built asynchronous, multi-threaded services using Python multiprocessing to
handle massive file queues and maintain low latency.

Engineered scalable pipelines using AWS services (S3, SQS, EC2) integrated
with IBM MQ for message-driven processing.

Designed modular pipelines to handle OCR (PaddleOCR, Textract) and
LLM-driven extraction using models like DONUT, LayoutLM, Pix2Struct.

Fine-tuned transformer models using LoRA, QLoRA, and PEFT to achieve
domain-specific extraction of names, amounts, dates, and checkboxes.

Implemented custom rule engines for validating extracted fields against
business rules (e.g., amount mismatch, missing signature).

Built dashboards using Grafana and Redash to monitor system metrics like job
failure rate, throughput, and accuracy.

Reduced document processing turnaround time by 45% and improved
extraction accuracy by 38% through iterative testing and model enhancement.
Coordinated with DevOps to set up CI/CD for auto-deployment of
microservices, ensuring rapid feature rollout.
