critical information such as insured party details, policy numbers, coverage
dates, limits, and endorsements from a wide variety of insurance documents
including Certificates of Insurance (COI), policy declaration pages, and more.

Utilized OCR and NLP techniques to enhance the accuracy of data extraction
from scanned documents and unstructured form layouts.

Integrated pre-trained models and custom rule-based logic for handling edge
cases and uncommon document formats.

Developed APIs to expose the extracted data to other systems and
stakeholders for further processing and analytics.

Set up and maintained CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitLab Cl/Jenkins to
automate testing, integration, and deployment workflows, reducing manual
overhead and deployment time.

Containerized the application using Docker, enabling consistent deployments
across development, staging, and production environments.

Worked with cloud services (e.g., AWS/GCP/Azure) to deploy scalable and
secure environments for running extraction services.
