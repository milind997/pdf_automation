An Al-based pipeline that extracts key fields from a wide variety of insurance forms for
downstream processing and claims automation.

Key Contributions:

e Engineered OCR-first document parsing pipelines using Tesseract, EasyOCR,
and fallback image preprocessing techniques.

Used PDFMiner and OpenCV to isolate structured zones such as checkboxes,
signature fields, tables, and input blocks.

Applied document template matching to route input documents to
appropriate parsing logic, increasing template match rate by 30%.

Developed a hybrid approach using rule-based parsing with prompt-based
LLMs (like Mistral and LayoutLM) for improved field recognition.

Containerized services using Docker, and integrated them with Kafka-based
message queues for scalable ingestion.

Enabled logging, retry mechanisms, and failure tracking for documents with
low confidence scores or extraction errors.

Built validation dashboards to allow manual correction and learning feedback
loop to further refine extraction logic.

@ applications.

e@ Implemented logging and monitoring tools for proactive issue resolution.

e@ Provided technical support and mentorship to junior developers.
