Project Title: Fraud/Tempered Document Detection

Data Scientist

Description: A fraud detection solution focused on identifying manipulation in scanned financial

and legal documents without needing training data.
Key Contributions:

e Developed CV-based forgery detection using OpenCV, contour analysis, and
histogram-based feature extraction.

Designed logic to detect anomalies like pixel shifts in digital signatures,
tampered font regions, cloned stamp areas, and image artifacts.

Created a preprocessing pipeline for image normalization, DPI correction,
and noise reduction to improve visual analysis accuracy.

Built modular components for batch document scoring, alerting, and visual
markup of suspected forgery zones.

Integrated the system into an internal workflow tool for verifying uploaded
documents and generating authenticity reports.

Added support for PDF and image formats with automatic parsing and report
generation in HTML/PDF for audit trails.

Designed field validation techniques comparing extracted text against
external APIs (e.g., PAN, Aadhaar, GST) for cross-verification.
